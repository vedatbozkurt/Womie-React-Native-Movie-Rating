### Requirements for React Native

#### iOS

- OS X
- Xcode 6.3 or higher is recommended (Xcode only runs on Mac).
- Homebrew is the recommended way to install node, watchman, and flow.
- `brew install node`
- `brew install watchman`. We recommend installing watchman, otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug.
- `brew install flow`. If you want to use flow.

#### Android

- Follow the official documentation guide here: http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#android-setup (includes experimental Windows & Linux support)

### Running the Mobile Apps

#### iOS

- Hit cmd+R in your iOS simulator to reload the app and see your change!

- Run the `react-native run-android` in the root of this project.
